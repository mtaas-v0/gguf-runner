# Module Structure Reference

This project is currently a binary crate (`src/main.rs`) with internal modules (`mod ...`), not a separate `lib.rs`.

## Maintenance Rule

- When architecture-related code changes, update this file in the same change.
- Keep this file as the current-state snapshot.

## Module Responsibilities

### `src/main.rs`

- Binary entrypoint (`fn main()`) and crate root wiring.
- Delegates runtime orchestration to `app::run()`.

### `src/app/mod.rs`

- Application orchestration entrypoint (`run()`).
- Executes end-to-end run pipeline:
  - parse CLI options
  - map CLI tuning flags into `engine::switches::RuntimeSwitchConfig`
  - initialize runtime switches via `engine::switches::init_runtime_config(...)`
  - initialize profiling
  - load runtime/model context via `app::generation`
  - validate non-empty media file paths for standard generation mode:
    - `--image` (`png/jpg/jpeg/webp`)
    - `--video` (`mp4`)
    - `--audio` (extension-agnostic validation in current scaffold)
  - route by operation mode:
    - `oneshot`: single prompt execution
    - `repl`: interactive question/answer loop with slash commands (`/help`, `/model`, `/exit`, `/quit`)
  - routes plain text-only non-agent turns through `generate_text(...)`; uses structured `GenerationRequest` execution only when media inputs are present
  - tool-agent support is orthogonal to operation mode:
    - default `allowed-tools=none` in `oneshot`
    - default `allowed-tools=all` in `repl`
    - when tools are enabled, the runner chooses between standard generation and `app::agent`
      based on prompt/tool eligibility rather than forcing every REPL turn through the agent planner
    - when tools are disabled, requests are handled via standard generation
  - print profiling/timing summaries

### `src/app/repl.rs`

- `crossterm` footer-style terminal UI for REPL mode.
- Owns:
  - main-screen terminal lifecycle with a fixed footer area
  - scroll-region management so model/debug output prints into the terminal's native scrollback above the footer
  - raw-mode key handling
  - visible input buffer editing
  - slash-command tab-completion at edit time
  - slash-command managed REPL state, including persistent image attachments (`/image`, `/images`, `/clear-images`, `/clear`)
  - prompt history navigation
  - rolling non-agent chat history for continuous multi-turn conversations
  - status line updates during turn execution:
    - standard generation progress uses prefill/decode counters, throughput, and a context gauge
    - agent/tool turns consume typed `RunnerStatus` values and render them as explicit phase labels such as planning, tool execution, finalizing, and recovery
  - a single background worker thread that owns the only `ModelRuntime` instance in `repl` mode
  - command/event channels between UI thread and runtime worker
  - streamed assistant output plus typed runner logs printed directly into terminal scrollback
- Uses native multimodal generation for turns with active image attachments, rather than routing image access through tool-agent calls.
- When tools are enabled, only tool-likely prompts are routed into the agent runner; ordinary chat remains on the standard text-generation path.
- Plain text REPL chat runs with `think=no` to avoid exposing raw chain-of-thought or losing the visible answer on reasoning-model chat templates; oneshot behavior remains unchanged.
- Active REPL media attachments can initialize external multimodal support lazily on first use, including local `mmproj` sidecar discovery/loading for sidecar-backed vision families.
- Loads the runtime inside the worker thread so the REPL owns runtime lifecycle end-to-end and enforces one active runtime.

### `src/app/events.rs`

- Shared app-level runtime event types for streamed REPL output.
- Defines the event callback used by:
  - `app::generation` for visible token chunks and debug lines
  - `app::agent` for typed runner logs, final output, and explicit footer status updates during agent turns
- Keeps event transport in `app/` so `engine/` stays independent of UI/orchestration concerns.
- The runner/UI boundary is typed:
  - `RuntimeEvent::Output(String)` for visible assistant text
  - `RuntimeEvent::Log(RuntimeLog)` for debug/system/error messages
  - `RuntimeEvent::Status(RunnerStatus)` for orchestration state such as planning, tool execution, finalizing, and recovery
  - `RuntimeEvent::Progress(RuntimeProgress)` for numeric decode/prefill progress

### `src/app/generation.rs`

- Model/runtime bootstrap for inference:
  - GGUF parse/load
  - llama-style local `mmproj*.gguf` sidecar discovery/probe for multimodal models (no extra CLI switch)
  - sidecar probe enforces checkpoint variant token matching (for example `2b`, `35b`, `a3b`) to prevent silent cross-size pairing
  - applies vendor multimodal/runtime debug policies to sidecar scoring, request shaping, and context-length debug logging
  - vendor config + tokenizer + weights initialization
  - multimodal weight-group probe/initialization for multimodal backends
  - context/thread overrides
- Token generation loop implementation.
- Exposes reusable generation APIs:
  - `generate_text(...)` for text-only prompts
  - `generate_chat_messages_for_repl(...)` for multi-turn REPL chat encoded through vendor-native chat templates
  - `generate_text_with_images(...)` (image path routes through structured request execution)
    - qwen35 image route appends a non-hallucination guard instruction for unreadable text regions
  - `generate_text_for_agent(...)` for strict agent JSON turns; uses vendor decode policy generically for deterministic agent-mode settings instead of family branches in app logic
  - `generate_request(...)` for structured multimodal requests (`GenerationRequest`) with:
    - structured prompt encoding via `vendors::encode_generation_request(...)`
    - placeholder-span/media alignment checks for image/video/audio inputs
    - fail-fast native capability checks when required multimodal tensors/components are missing
      - capability-probe details (`image/video/audio`) are included in diagnostics, including sidecar search/probe status
    - native image/video/audio preprocessing execution prior to embedding path
      - images: decode + resize/crop + normalize + CHW tensor conversion
      - for external mmproj vision backends, image resize target is taken from encoder metadata (for example `clip.vision.image_size`) instead of a fixed 224x224 fallback
      - qwen35 backend uses fit-within preprocessing (aspect-ratio preserving, patch-aligned) at a balanced intermediate scale to retain full-frame text regions while limiting visual-token overload
      - gemma3 backend uses fixed-size stretch resize to encoder image_size (llama.cpp-compatible SigLIP preprocess semantics)
      - videos: currently unavailable in no-external-dependency mode
      - audio: currently unavailable in no-external-dependency mode
    - native image embedding execution via in-engine multimodal backend (`qwen3vl`/`qwen35` mmproj sidecar path)
      - Gemma3 sidecar path uses `<start_of_image>`/`<end_of_image>` prompt markers and SigLIP-style projector pooling
    - think-tag decode safeguards:
      - hidden-think mode enforces vendor-bounded think/total token caps
      - visible-think mode reserves answer budget after `</think>` and enforces a vendor-bounded visible think phase
      - multimodal turns can be forced to hidden-think by vendor decode policy without changing the global CLI think setting
    - structured-output decode safeguards:
      - generic structured-output mode selector in generation settings
      - current `agent-json` mode seeds a compact JSON prefix for tool-agent turns
      - lexical/schema-aware token masking for `tool_call` / `final` responses
      - stop after first complete top-level JSON object
    - explicit current-state errors for unimplemented native video/audio embedding execution
  - shared decode core `generate_from_prefill(...)` for text + multimodal routes (supports per-position embedding overrides during prefill)
- Supports optional app-level runtime event callbacks:
  - streamed visible output chunks for TUI REPL
  - debug-line emission without writing directly to terminal during REPL turns
- For REPL multi-turn chat, trims oldest encoded turns when chat history outgrows the model context window, preserving the newest exchange.

### `src/rag/mod.rs`

- RAG module entrypoint and shared index types.
- Owns:
  - index build orchestration from chunked source documents
  - exact duplicate-chunk elimination ahead of tokenisation/embedding
  - tokenizer priming plus parallel chunk tokenisation ahead of embedding
  - dynamically scheduled chunk embedding/progress reporting
  - in-memory embedding matrix assembly for retrieval
  - cosine-similarity retrieval plus keyword rescue
  - prompt-context injection helpers
- Keeps RAG-specific indexing and retrieval flow outside `app/` and `engine/`, while consuming generic engine/runtime primitives and the sidecar encoder exposed by `src/rag/encoder.rs`.

### `src/rag/chunker.rs`

- Source-to-chunk preprocessing for RAG indexing.
- Walks document trees, splits markdown by heading/paragraph structure, and applies lightweight language-aware chunking for supported code files.

### `src/rag/encoder.rs`

- Embedding sidecar GGUF loader and document/query embedding runtime.
- Owns tokenizer use for the sidecar model, pooling policy, reusable BERT prefill scratch buffers, fused-QKV staging, head-major attention staging, cached RoPE tables, and the embedding fast path used during index builds and retrieval.

### `src/rag/index_io.rs`

- Binary `.ragidx` serialization/deserialization for persisted RAG indexes.
- Encodes chunk metadata and embedding vectors for save/load without coupling persistence details into the retrieval path.

### `src/app/agent.rs`

- Engine-owned agent runner/tool loop:
  - one agent turn = one structured model decision (`tool_call` or `final`)
  - agent JSON is used only for control flow; final user-facing prose is generated in a separate plain-text step so long answers are not forced into JSON strings
  - retries malformed agent JSON up to a vendor-policy-defined budget
  - can fall back to plain chat for weak models after repeated malformed non-tool turns, using clean chat history instead of the internal protocol-repair transcript
- Internal runner roles are split explicitly:
  - `AgentPlanner` handles structured control decisions
  - `ToolRunner` executes host tools and produces transcript entries
  - `FinalAnswerGenerator` produces the final plain-text answer after planning completes
- Emits typed runner logs/status into `app::events` so UI code does not infer runner state from raw model text or free-form status strings.

- Tool-agent orchestration loop for multi-step runs.
- Entrypoint accepts per-turn prompt text, so the same agent loop can be used from both `oneshot` and `repl` modes.
- Builds turn prompt transcript, requests one model response per turn, and parses JSON outputs.
- Agent replies are expected as compact single-object JSON with fixed key order; runtime constrains decode to the two supported schemas.
- Builds system prompt with tool catalog metadata (description / when-to-use) and optional allowed-shell-command descriptions supplied by `cli`.
- Executes tool calls through `tools::ToolExecutor` and appends tool results back into transcript.
- Exposes both:
  - direct stdout/stderr execution for `oneshot`
  - collected event output for TUI-driven `repl`
  - immediate app-level runtime event emission during tool-agent turns when a callback is installed
- Terminates on `final` response or configured tool-call limit.

### `src/tools.rs`

- Host-side tool execution + canonical tool-name catalog.
- Defines stable tool-name constants and `ALL_TOOL_NAMES` used by both `cli` and tool dispatch.
- Provides safe file tools:
  - `read_file`
  - `write_file`
  - `list_dir`
  - `mkdir` (recursive create)
  - `rmdir` (recursive delete; never removes `tool_root`)
  - `shell_list_allowed`
- Provides restricted external command tools:
  - `shell_exec` (only for allowed command names)
  - `shell_request_allowed` (structured request to operator)
- Enforces tool root path constraints and per-call payload limits.

### `src/cli.rs`

- All clap parsing lives here.
- Public parser result type: `CliOptions`.
- Parses user-facing flags plus hidden tuning/debug options.
- Env var integration is here (via clap `env = ...`), currently `GGUF_*` variables.
- Loads optional layered TOML config for agent shell allowed commands:
  - `~/.gguf-runner/config.toml`
  - `./.gguf-runner/config.toml` (overrides home config)
- Supports single-source command metadata in `[shell.cmd]` (key=command, value=description); `[shell.md]` and older formats remain accepted for compatibility.
- Supports optional tool config in `[tools]`:
  - internal tool toggles (all default enabled)
- Includes operation/tool-mode switches:
  - `--mode oneshot|repl`
  - `--allowed-tools <list>` (comma-separated tool names, or `all` / `none`, validated against `tools::ALL_TOOL_NAMES`)
  - hidden compatibility alias `--agent` (maps to tools-enabled behavior)
- Includes agent/tool related switches:
  - `--tool-root`
  - `--allow-shell-command`
  - `--max-tool-calls`
- Includes multimodal switch:
  - repeatable `--image <path>` for image inputs (standard generation mode)
  - repeatable `--video <path>` for video inputs (standard generation mode)
  - repeatable `--audio <path>` for audio inputs (standard generation mode)

- `sampling.rs`: token selection helpers (`argmax`, multinomial sample, top-k/top-p sampler).

### `src/engine/runtime/*`

- Runtime-specific execution and threading config.

  - Rejects unsupported DeepSeek architectures (`deepseek*`) with a clear config error.
  - Builds `Config` from family-specific key conventions.
  - Detects `qwen35` explicitly and maps it onto the Qwen3Next-style runtime path.
  - Keeps `qwen35*` checkpoints on `qwen35` vendor prompt/decode policies even when the runtime executes their recurrent/SSM layers through the Qwen3Next-style engine path.
  - Sets generic runtime feature flags on `Config` from vendor/model metadata so engine code can consume runtime behavior without new family branches.
  - Probes multimodal capability from tokenizer special tokens + GGUF tensor prefixes for `gemma3`, `qwen3vl`, and `qwen35`.
  - Performs vendor-specific mmproj sidecar compatibility checks (`validate_mmproj_for_backend(...)`) including projector type, projection dim matching, and Qwen family/deepstack guards.
  - Dispatches vendor policies used by app/tokenizer decode paths:

    - `tokenizer_policy(...)` returning `VendorTokenizerPolicy`
    - `multimodal_policy(...)` returning `VendorMultimodalPolicy` (image prompt suffix, detail-crop behavior, mmproj candidate scoring hints, sidecar diagnostics hint)
    - `runtime_debug_policy(...)` returning `VendorRuntimeDebugPolicy` (family-specific native-context debug label)
  - Routes both simple chat prompt encoding and structured `GenerationRequest` encoding to family-specific implementation.
- `vendors/llama.rs`, `vendors/gemma.rs`, `vendors/qwen*.rs`:
  - Family-specific defaults, validations, prompt rendering, and family-owned policy constructors.
  - Qwen family is split by variant:
    - `qwen2.rs`: Qwen2 chat template + baseline decode/tokenizer policies.
    - `qwen3.rs`: Qwen3-MoE defaults/validation helpers and Qwen3 prompt wrappers.
    - `qwen35.rs`: Qwen3.5 decode/tokenizer/multimodal policies (detail-crop opt-in and sidecar hints).
    - `qwen3vl.rs`: Qwen3-VL decode/tokenizer/multimodal policies.
    - `qwen3next.rs`: Qwen3-Next SSM validation/debug + decode/tokenizer policies.
    - `qwen_common.rs`: shared Qwen stop-token constants, runtime debug policy, and Qwen3 structured prompt encoder with image/video/audio placeholder-span mapping.

## Runtime Data Flow

1. `main.rs` invokes `app::run()`.
2. `app::run()` parses CLI (`CliOptions`).
3. `app::run()` builds `RuntimeSwitchConfig` and calls `engine::switches::init_runtime_config(...)`.
4. GGUF parsed via `engine::io::parse_gguf_file(...)`.
5. Vendor config built with `vendors::build_config_from_gguf(...)`.
6. Vendor tokenizer, multimodal, and runtime debug policies are built (`vendors::{tokenizer_policy,multimodal_policy,runtime_debug_policy}(...)`) and tokenizer is initialized (`engine::tokenizer::init_tokenizer_from_gguf(...)`).
7. Runtime overrides applied (`engine::runtime::apply_context_size_overrides(...)`), with vendor runtime-context debug logging handled in app.
8. Weights loaded (`engine::weights::init_weights_from_gguf(...)`).
9. Standard mode:
  - CLI media inputs are normalized into `engine::types::GenerationRequest` with `ContentPart` items.
  - prompt encoded via `vendors::encode_generation_request(...)`, including placeholder spans for image/video/audio on Qwen multimodal paths and image spans on Gemma multimodal path.
  - runtime validates prompt/media alignment before starting preprocessing.
  - if native multimodal tensors are unavailable, runtime fails with a qualified native-capability error that includes architecture/token/tensor probe details.
  - vendor decode policy built (`vendors::decode_policy(...)`) and applied by the token loop for think-tag parsing, phase-bounded visible/hidden think decoding, stop-token matching, deterministic loop-guard behavior, and vendor-enabled think-recovery retries.
  - token loop executes forward passes (`engine::runtime::transformer(...)`) + sampling (`engine::kernels`); native media embedding injection remains in progress.
10. Agent mode:
  - tool transcript prompt encoded per turn
  - model emits JSON `tool_call` / `final`
  - host executes tool call (`tools`) and loops until final response or limit.
  - `shell_exec` calls are restricted to CLI/env-provided allowed commands; model can request missing commands with `shell_request_allowed`.
11. Profiling/timings printed from `engine::profiling` + `app::run()`.

## Placement Rules For Future Changes

- New CLI flags or env vars: `src/cli.rs`.
- End-to-end run orchestration: `src/app/mod.rs`.
- New runtime tuning switches or arch toggles: `src/engine/switches.rs`.
- New profiling counters/reporting: `src/engine/profiling.rs`.
- New math/quant/sampling primitive: `src/engine/kernels/*`.
- New model-family metadata or prompt format: `src/vendors/<family>.rs` + dispatch in `src/vendors/mod.rs`.
- New GGUF parsing logic: `src/engine/io/gguf.rs`.
- New tensor loading logic: `src/engine/weights.rs`.
- Keep `src/main.rs` focused on entrypoint + crate wiring.

## Validation Workflow

- Run these checks for refactor validation:
  - `cargo check`
  - `rg -n "^use crate::\\*;" src/engine -g'*.rs'`
  - `rg -n "^use crate::engine::[A-Za-z0-9_:]+::\\*;" src/engine -g'*.rs'`
  - `rg -n "crate::cli::" src/engine -g'*.rs'`
- Expected result for all `rg` checks above: no matches.

## Known Coupling (Current State)

- `engine` no longer depends on `cli` types directly; runtime switch wiring happens in `app`.
- `main.rs` no longer re-exports `engine::types::*`; `vendors` and `engine` import from `engine::*` modules directly.
- `src/engine/*` no longer uses wildcard imports for internal crate modules.
- Remaining wildcard imports in `engine` are architecture-intrinsics (`std::arch::*`) for SIMD code paths.

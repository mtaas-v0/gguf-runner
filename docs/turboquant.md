Abstract
```
```
Vector quantization, a problem rooted in Shannon’s source coding theory, aims to quantize
high-dimensional Euclidean vectors while minimizing distortion in their geometric structure. We
proposeTurboQuantto address both mean-squared error (MSE) and inner product distor-
tion, overcoming limitations of existing methods that fail to achieve optimal distortion rates.
Our data-oblivious algorithms, suitable for online applications, achieve near-optimal distortion
rates (within a small constant factor) across all bit-widths and dimensions. TurboQuant
achieves this by randomly rotating input vectors, inducing a concentrated Beta distribution
on coordinates, and leveraging the near-independence property of distinct coordinates in high
dimensions to simply apply optimal scalar quantizers per each coordinate. Recognizing that
MSE-optimal quantizers introduce bias in inner product estimation, we propose a two-stage ap-
proach: applying an MSE quantizer followed by a 1-bit Quantized JL (QJL) transform on the
residual, resulting in an unbiased inner product quantizer. We also provide a formal proof of
the information-theoretic lower bounds on best achievable distortion rate by any vector quan-
tizer, demonstrating thatTurboQuantclosely matches these bounds, differing only by a small
constant (≈ 2 .7) factor. Experimental results validate our theoretical findings, showing that
for KV cache quantization, we achieve absolute quality neutrality with 3.5 bits per channel and
marginal quality degradation with 2.5 bits per channel. Furthermore, in nearest neighbor search
tasks, our method outperforms existing product quantization techniques in recall while reducing
indexing time to virtually zero.

## 1 Introduction

Vector quantization (VQ) in Euclidean space is crucial for efficiently handling high-dimensional
vectors across a spectrum of computational domains, from training and deploying large-scale AI
and deep learning models to powering vector databases for search/retrieval systems. The core
objective is to compress high dimensional vectors by quantizing them–converting floating-point co-
ordinate values to low-bitwidth integers–while minimizing distortion, quantified by metrics such as

mean-squared error (MSE) or inner product errors. By preserving these properties, inner prod-
uct queries can be answered rapidly, with minimal latency, and using reduced computational and
communication resources.

This problem’s roots trace back to Shannon’s seminal work on Source Coding theory [48, 49], which
established that the least distortion achievable by block source codes, now known as vector quan-
tizers, is defined by the Shannon distortion-rate function, determined by the statistical properties
of the source and the chosen distortion measure, such as MSE. Today, VQ plays a critical role in
fundamental computational domains, including AI, deep learning, and search systems.

A key application of VQ is in the deployment of AI models, including large language models
(LLMs) [5, 18, 7, 52]. As LLM capabilities depend heavily on their model size and context length [34],
serving them requires substantial memory demands and increased inference latency. This latency
is primarily attributed to communication bottlenecks between HBM and SRAM on accelerators, or
across distributed clusters. By compressing or quantizing model weights and activations, we can
effectively mitigate these bottlenecks, resulting in significant reductions in inference costs. Inner
product operations between activations and weights is at the core of deep learning models. Thus,
model quantization schemes strive to compress weights and/or activation vectors while accurately
preserving these inner products.

Decoder based transformer models [54] present another compelling use case. These models must
store key/value (KV) embeddings from previously generated tokens in the KV cache, the size of
which scales with both model size (number of layers and attention heads) and context length. This
scaling is a significant bottleneck in terms of memory usage and computational speed, especially
for long context models. Therefore, reducing the KV cache size without compromising accuracy is
essential. In this context, the preservation of the Euclidean structure of these embedding vectors–
their inner products and distances–is crucial for maintaining model performance. VQ emerges as
the most suitable framework for addressing this challenge, offering a robust approach to compressing
high-dimensional embeddings while preserving their essential geometric properties.

Additionally, nearest neighbor (NN) search in high-dimensional spaces with inner product or cosine
similarity [1, 27] is a cornerstone of vector databases [4, 2, 3]. These databases are fundamental
for retrieval-augmented generation [23, 19] and information retrieval [35, 46]. VQ, a.k.a. product
quantization (PQ), plays a critical role in these applications. It enables efficient compression of
database vectors, optimizes memory usage, and facilitates low-latency, accurate estimations of inner
products with query vectors, thereby enabling fast and precise nearest neighbor searches.

Existing VQ algorithms present a trade-off: either they lack accelerator (vectorization) compatibility
and exhibit slow computation, making them unsuitable for real-time AI applications like KV cache
quantization, or they suffer from suboptimal distortion bounds relative to bit-width. Our objective
is to introduce an algorithm that addresses these limitations. Specifically, we designTurboQuant:
a lightweight, capable of online application (crucial for scenarios like KV cache quantization), and
highly accelerator-friendly—a critical attribute for modern AI workloads.

The core ofTurboQuantis a two-stage process. First, we develop a vector quantizer with optimal
distortion rate in terms of mean-squared error (MSE). Subsequently, we apply a 1-bit quantizer to
the residual, resulting in an unbiased and low-distortion inner product quantizer. We demonstrate
that quantizers optimized for MSE do not produce unbiased estimators for inner products, and


our two-stage solution effectively bridges this gap. Our MSE-optimal quantizer starts by randomly
rotatingd-dimensional input vectors. Observing the key fact that each coordinate in the rotated vec-
tors follows a Beta distribution, we design optimal Lloyd-Max quantizer [42, 43] for each coordinate
by solving a continuous k-means problem. This method gives optimal MSE distortion bound and
minimizes the L2 norm of the residual. To obtain an unbiased and low-distortion quantizer for inner
products, we compose our quantizer with the recently developed Quantized Johnson-Lindenstrauss
(QJL) transform [62], which quantizes each coordinate of the residual vector to a single bit. Our
algorithm offers provably optimal distortion bounds for both MSE and inner products, achieving
an exponential improvement over existing methods in terms of bit-width dependence.

### 1.1 Problem Definition

Formally, our goal is to design a quantization map, denoted asQ:Rd→ { 0 , 1 }B, that transforms
d-dimensional vectors to a binary string ofB bits. If we set B = b·dfor some b≥ 0, this
quantizer will have a bit-width ofb, representing the average number of bits used to encode each real-
valued coordinate ofRd. Crucially, we require an inverse map,Q−^1 :{ 0 , 1 }B→Rdthat performs
dequantization, approximately reconstructing original vectors from their quantized representations.
Of course, this transformation is inherently lossy, asQis not a bijection. So, our primary objective
is to minimize distortion, with a specific focus on mean-squared error (MSE) and inner product
distortion.

We make no assumptions about the input vector dataset, considering the worst-case scenario. We
let the quantizerQ(·) to be randomized, leading to stochastic outputs. Considering randomized
quantizers, it is more appropriate to define the expected distortion over the randomness of the
quantizer’s output. Thus, we aim to design quantizers that for any desired bit-widthbminimize
the following expected distortion measures for any (worst-case) vectorsx,y∈Rd:

```
(MSE) Dmse:=E
Q
```
```
h
```
(^) x−Q−^1 (Q(x))^2

i
(1)
(inner-prod error) Dprod:=E
Q
h
(^) ⟨y,x⟩−⟨y,Q−^1 (Q(x))⟩

i

. (2)

The expectations above are takes with respect to the randomness of the quantizerQ(·). Furthermore,
for inner-product quantizers, we require unbiasedness of the inner product estimator, a desirable
property for numerous applications. More precisely, we require:

```
(unbiased inner-prod) E
Q
```
#### 

```
⟨y,Q−^1 (Q(x))⟩
```
#### 

```
=⟨y,x⟩.
```
We aim to design computationally efficient quantizersQmseandQprod, that achieve optimal bounds
for the distortion measures defined above, for any given bit-widthb. Additionally, we aim forQprod
to provide unbiased inner product estimates. In particular, assume that we are givennreal-valued
vectorsx 1 ,x 2 ,...xn∈Rd. We design the following primitives:

- Quant: efficiently quantizes the dataset and computesQ(x 1 ),Q(x 2 ),...Q(xn).
- DeQuant: given a quantized dataset, can efficiently reconstruct original vectors by computing
    Q−^1 (Q(xi)) for anyi∈[n].


### 1.2 Related Work

Beginnings of VQ. The vector quantization theory started by Shannon’s seminal work [48, 49]
on achievable distortion-rate functions. In 1963, Zador [61] made significant advances by employing
high-resolution methods to derive the limiting operational distortion-rate function for fixed-rate
quantization at high rates that closely matches Shannon’s distortion-rate function. However, Zador
did not specifically consider implementable algorithms. Gersho’s influential paper [25], further ad-
vanced the vector quantization by popularizing high-resolution theory, simplifying Zador’s results,
introducing lattice vector quantization, and proposing a key conjecture that shaped the field. De-
spite these theoretical advancements, the practical applicability of vector quantization remained
unclear in early years. The most straightforward encoding method, brute-force nearest neighbor
search, was computationally expensive, hindering the adoption of VQ in practice.

Online vs Offline Quantization. Online (data-oblivious) quantization methods apply instantly
without needing data-specific tuning or calibrations [16, 8, 41, 47, 28]. In contrast, offline (data-
dependent) methods require heavy preprocessing and learning to adapt the quantization map to
the data, making them unsuitable for dynamic data scenarios [37]. For instance, methods such as
those presented in [20, 39, 57, 13] use second-order (Hessian) information to tune the quantization
map which requires heavy preprocessing and even in some cases post processing as well.

Online KV Cache Compression. Several approaches have been proposed to compress the KV
cache. These include architectural modifications [50, 6, 15] which restructure the transformer to
minimize the number of stored key-value pairs. Additionally, pruning or evicting redundant or less
critical tokens has emerged as another approach [11, 66, 40, 58, 64, 38, 29].

A simple yet effective approach to reducing KV cache size is quantizing the KV cache. Several
quantization techniques have been developed specifically for this purpose [60, 59, 17, 33, 65, 41, 30,
36, 28]. Recently, a new quantization called QJL [62] introduced an efficient, data-oblivious 1-bit
quantization approach based on sketching techniques, which provides unbiased estimates for inner
product queries. This method does not require tuning or adaptation to the input data and we make
use of this technology in our quantizer optimized for inner product distortion.

Product Quantization (PQ). In Near Neighbor (NN) search problem with Euclidean datasets,
the index size poses a significant memory bottleneck, often mitigated by quantization techniques,
commonly referred to as Product Quantization (PQ) in the NN literature. Many of these algo-
rithms rely on constructing a quantization codebook using variations of k-means during the index-
ing phase [31, 9, 24, 56, 27]. Therefore, these methods are ill-suited for online settings due to their
requirement for extensive preprocessing.

Recently, a grid-based PQ method was introduced in [22], eliminating the need for preprocessing.
This approach operates by projecting a uniform grid onto the unit sphere and conducting a search
to identify the nearest projection to the data points. While the paper’s theoretical guarantees are
suboptimal, likely due to loose analysis—as practical performance surpasses theoretical bounds—the
grid projection and binary search algorithm is also computationally slow and particularly inefficient


on accelerators like GPU because of their algorithm’s inherent lack of vectorization, which prevents
parallel processing.

### 1.3 Overview of Techniques and Contributions

MSE Optimzied TurboQuant. Our first VQ algorithm is designed to minimize MSE distortion
deinfed in Eq. (1). To achieve this, we apply a random rotation to the input vectors, thereby
inducing a Beta distribution on each coordinate, irrespective of the input vectors themselves. In high
dimensionsd, the distribution of each coordinate converges to a Gaussian distributionN(1, 1 /d)
due to concentration of measure and the central limit theorem. Furthermore, any two distinct
coordinates become nearly uncorrelated and, more importantly, almost independent (a deeper result
that goes beyond just correlation). This near-independence is a crucial aspect that simplifies our
quantization design. It allows us to quantize each coordinate using optimal scalar quantization,
disregarding interactions or correlations between different coordinates, while still achieving near-
optimal distortion.

We find optimal scalar quantizers for random variables with Beta distributions by solving a con-
tinuous 1-dimensional k-means problem using the Max-Lloyd algorithm. We precompute and store
these optimal codebooks for a range of practically useful bit-widths, to enable efficient subsequent
invocations of ourTurboQuantalgorithm.

In Theorem 1 we prove that theb-bit MSE optimizedTurboQuantQmse:Rd→{ 0 , 1 }b·dachieves
the following distortion for any worst-case vectorx∈Rdwith∥x∥= 1:

- For small bit-widths the above distortion upper bound can be further refined. Specifically, for
    b= 1, 2 , 3 ,4 we haveDmse(Qmse)≈ 0. 36 , 0. 117 , 0. 03 , 0. 009 , respectively.

Note that the unit norm assumption,∥x∥ 2 = 1, is standard and not restrictive. For datasets that
do not satisfy this assumption we can compute and store theL2 norms in floating-point precision
and rescale the dequantized points using these stored norms.

Inner Product TurboQuant. We show that the MSE optimized quantizers are biased for inner
product estimation and thus a different VQ scheme is needed to get an unbiased inner product
quantizer. Our solution is a two stage algorithm that first applies the abovementionedQmsewith a
bit-width one less than our target budget and then apply a QJL [62] on the residual error. This is
proved to be unbiased and also has nearly optimal inner product error rate.

In Theorem 2 we prove that theb-bit inner product optimizedTurboQuantQprod:Rd→{ 0 , 1 }b·d
achieves the following distortion for any worst-case vectorsx,y∈Rdwith∥x∥= 1:

- For small bit-widths the above distortion upper bound can be further refined. Specifically, for
    b= 1, 2 , 3 ,4 we haveDprod(Qprod)≈^1 .d^57 ,^0 .d^56 ,^0 .d^18 ,^0.^047 d , respectively.

Lower Bound. In Theorem 3, we leverage Shannon’s lower bound and Yao’s minimax principle
to prove that for any randomized quantization algorithmQ:Rd→{ 0 , 1 }b·dwith bit-widthb, there
exist hard input instancesx,y∈Rdwith∥x∥= 1 such that the following lower bounds hold:

As demonstrated by our lower bounds,TurboQuant’s MSE distortion is provably within a factor
of at most
√
3 π
2 ≈^2.^7 of the information-theoretical lower bound. Notably, for smaller bit-widths,
this factor significantly decreases. For instance, at a bit-width ofb= 1TurboQuantachieves a
distortion that is only a factor of approximately 1. 45 away from the optimal which is also confirmed
by our experimental results, indicating its efficiency in low-bit-width scenarios.
Experimental Results. In Section 4.1, we empirically validate our theoretical distortion bounds,
demonstrating thatTurboQuant’s observed distortions closely align with our predictions across
various real-world datasets, approaching the established lower bounds.
Furthermore, in Section 4.2 and Section 4.3, we showcaseTurboQuant’s efficacy in online KV
cache quantization. Specifically, we achieve perfect long-context retrieval in needle-in-a-haystack
tasks and maintain high performance on other long-context downstream tasks, all while compressing
the KV cache by a factor exceeding 5×.
Finally in Section 4.4 we applyTurboQuantto various high-dimensional near neighbor search
tasks. TurboQuantconsistently outperforms data-dependent product quantization (PQ), while
reducing the indexing time to essentially zero.

## 2 Preliminaries

We use boldface lowercase letters, such asxandy, to denote vectors, and boldface uppercase
letters, likeM, to denote matrices. To denote a slice of a vectorxbetween the coordinate indicesi
andjinclusive of the endpoints, we use the notationxi:j. For a matrixM, we writeMi,:to denote
itsi-th row vector, which we will simply refer to asMi.

We use the notationSd−^1 to denote the hypersphere inRdof radius 1. For a random variablex
we denote its differential entropy ash(x). For random variablesxandy, the mutual information
between them is denoted asI(x;y) =h(x)−h(x|y).

Given thatTurboQuantemploys random rotation to mitigate worst-case input scenarios, under-
standing the statistical properties of random points on a hypersphere is essential. The following
lemma outlines one such property that we will need for analysis and design purposes:


Lemma 1(coordinate distribution of random point on hypersphere). For any positive integerdif
x∈Sd−^1 is a random variable uniformly distributed over the unit hypersphere, then for anyj∈[d]
the coordinatexj follows the following (scaled/shifted) Beta distribution:

### 2.1 Shannon Lower Bound on Distortion

The Shannon Lower Bound (SLB) is a powerful tool, derived from Shannon’s lossy source coding
theorem [49], that provides a universal lower bound on the optimal achievable distortion rate for
any lossy compression scheme. Specifically, we use a version of SLB tailored for the mean-squared
error (MSE) distortion measure applied to generald-dimensional sources.

Lemma 2(SLB). Letx∈Rd be a random vector with an arbitrary probability distributionpX
and finite differential entropyh(x). Define the MSE distortion-rate functionD(B)for total bit
complexityB≥ 0 as:
D(pX,B) := inf

```
D(pX,B)≥

```

· 2 (2/d)(h(x)−B).
```
This is a classic result proved using backward Gaussian test channel (for a proof see [14]). Our
lower bound result uses a corollary of SLB that corresponds to the uniformly distributed random
points on the unit hyeprsphere. We present this in the following lemma:

Lemma 3(SLB for random point on hypersphere). Letx∈Sd−^1 be a random variable uniformly
distributed over the unit hypersphere and define the MSE distortion-rate functionD(B)for total bit
complexityBas per Lemma 2. Then, for any bit complexityB≥ 0 , the following distortion lower
bound holds:
D(B)≥ 2 −^2 B/d.


Proof.If we letAddenote the area of the hypersphereSd−^1 , the entropy of uniform distribution

### 2.2 QJL: 1-bit inner product quantization

As previously stated, we design two VQ algorithms: one optimized for minimizing MSE and the
other for minimizing inner product error. We show that MSE-optimal quantizers do not necessarily
provide unbiased inner product estimates, particularly exhibiting significant bias at lower bit-widths.
Our solution for inner product quantization is a two-stage algorithm. First, we apply the MSE-
optimal quantizer using one less bit than the desired bit-width budget, thus minimizing the L
norm of the residuals. Next we apply an unbiased and optimal single-bit quantizer to the residual.
For the single-bit inner product quantizer, we utilize the recently proposed Quantized Johnson-
Lindenstrauss (QJL) algorithm [62], which is an optimal inner product quantizer with a bit-width
of one. Here, we present the QJL algorithm and its essential theoretical guarantees.

Definition 1(QJL). For any positive integerdthe QJL mapQqjl:Rd→{− 1 ,+1}dis defined as:

```
Qqjl(x) :=sign(S·x) for anyx∈Rd,
```
whereS ∈ Rd×d is a random matrix with i.i.d. entries sampled from the normal distribution
N(0,1)and thesignfunction is applied entry-wise to its vector input. The inverse/dequantization

In the next lemma we restate the results from [62] that show the QJL is unbiased and also has small
inner product distortion:

## 3 TurboQuant: High Performance Quantization

We developed two VQ algorithms, each tailored to a specific objective. The first algorithm is de-
signed to minimize the MSE between the original and reconstructed vectors after quantization. The
second algorithm is optimized for unbiased inner product estimation, addressing the bias inherent
in MSE-optimal quantizers. These algorithms are detailed in the following subsections.

Furthermore, in Section 3.3, we establish information-theoretic lower bounds on the best achievable
distortion rates for any vector quantizer. This analysis demonstrates thatTurboQuantachieve
near-optimality, differing from the lower bound by only a small constant factor across all bit-widths.

### 3.1 MSE Optimal TurboQuant

Letx∈Sd−^1 be a (worst-case) vector on the unit sphere in dimensiond. We aim to quantizex
tobbits per coordinate while minimizing the reconstruction MSE defined in Eq. (1). We start
by randomizing this vector by multiplying it with a random rotation matrixΠ∈Rd×d. We can
generateΠby applying QR decomposition on a random matrix with i.i.d Normal entries.

The resulting rotated vector,Π·x, is uniformly distributed on the unit sphereSd−^1. As shown
in Lemma 1, each coordinate ofΠ·xfollows a Beta distribution, which converges to a normal
distribution in high dimensions. Furthermore, in high dimensions, distinct coordinates ofΠ·x
become nearly independent [55], allowing us to apply optimal scalar quantizers to each coordinate
independently. Therefore, by Lemma 1, our task reduces to designing a scalar quantizer for random

variables with the distributionfX(x) =√π·Γ((Γ(d/d−2)1)/2)

The optimal scalar quantization problem, given a known probability distribution, can be framed
as a continuous k-means problem in dimension one. Specifically, we aim to partition the interval
[− 1 ,1] into 2bclusters/buckets. The optimal solution adheres to a Voronoi tessellation [42], mean-
ing interval boundaries are the midpoints between consecutive centroids, when arranged in sorted
order. Therefore, withci’s denoting the centroids in ascending order, we can formulate the scalar

will bound to prove the upper bound on the end-to-end MSE ofTurboQuant. The problem in
Eq. (4) can be solved using iterative numerical methods to achieve any desired precision. We solve
Eq. (4) for a range of practically relevant bit-widthsbonce, and store the results for future uses by
the quantizer.

For example, in moderately high dimensionsd, where the distributionfX(x) closely approximates

a normal distribution, the optimal quantization centroids for bit-widthsb= 1,2 are

```
√^2 /π

```
#### 

and
n

```
o
, respectively.
```
Therefore the quantizerQmse:Rd→ { 0 , 1 }b·dfirst computesΠ·xand then computes and stores
the indices of the nearest centroids to each coordinate of this vector. The dequantization map
Q−mse^1 :{ 0 , 1 }b·d→Rdreconstructs the vector by retrieving the centroids corresponding to the stored
indices and then rotating the result back to the original basis through multiplication withΠ⊤. A
pseudocode for these procedures is given in Algorithm 1.

We are now ready to prove our main theorem forTurboQuantmse.

Theorem 1(performance guarantee: TurboQuantmse). For any bit-widthb≥ 1 and any vector
x∈Sd−^1 , the procedureQuantmse(x)in Algorithm 1 outputs an index vectoridx∈[2b]d. When
this index vector is passed to the primitiveDeQuantmse(idx), it produces a reconstructed vector
x ̃∈Rdthat satisfies the following distortion bounds:

- MSE defined asDmse:=Ex ̃[∥x−x ̃∥^22 ]is bounded byDmse≤

```
√

```
```

4 b for anyb≥^0.
```

- For small bit-widths, specificallyb= 1, 2 , 3 , 4 the MSE exhibits finer-grained distortion values:
    Dmse≈ 0. 36 , 0. 117 , 0. 03 , 0. 009 , respectively.

Proof.We start the proof by showing thatDmse=d·C(fX,b), whereC(fX,b) is the optimal MSE
cost for scalar quantizer defined in Eq. (4). Lety ̃be defined as per line 9 of Algorithm 1. SinceΠ
is a rotation matrix we can write: ∥x−x ̃∥ 2 =∥Π·x−y ̃∥ 2. Using the notationy=Π·xas per
line 5 of Algorithm 1 and plugging this into the definition ofDmsewe can write:

```
Dmse=E[∥y−y ̃∥^22 ]

The third equality above follows from the definition ofy ̃in line 9 of Algorithm 1 and the fourth line
above follows because allyj’s have identical distribution ofyj∼fX(·) as shown in Lemma 1. The
last two lines above follows becausecidxjis chosen to be the nearest centroid to each coordinateyj
in line 6.

Now we must bound the optimal k-means costC(fX,b). For moderate values ofd,fX→N(0, 1 /d).
By numerically solving the optimization problem in Eq. (4) for valuesb= 1, 2 , 3 ,4 we get that
C(fX,b)≈^0 .d^36 ,^0.^117 d ,^0 .d^03 ,^0.^009 d , respectively. For larger bit-widthsb >4, we can apply the Panter-
Dite [44] high-resolution formula for the distortion of a fixed-rate scalar quantizer, yielding the
following bound:

```
C(fX,b)≤

This completes the proof.

Entropy Encoding Codebook Pointers. TurboQuant’s efficiency can be further increased
by applying entropy encoding to the indices that point to the closest codebook elements. Specifically,
the probability of each codeword index appearing in the quantized vectors can be computed as

pℓ:=

```
Rcℓ+c 2 ℓ+
cℓ− 1 +cℓ
2
```
```
fX(x)dx. Optimally coding the indices, reduces the average bit-width to nearly the
```
entropy of the distribution{pi}i∈[2b]. This lossless compression does not affect the distortion and
provides a bit-width reduction at no cost. The most significant reduction occurs forb= 4, where
the entropy of{pi}i∈[2b]is approximately 3.8. Detailed calculations for optimal prefix codes reveal
that the average bit-width can be reduced by 5%. However, given the limited gain, we have chosen
not to incorporate this technique intoTurboQuantto maintain simplicity and speed.

### 3.2 Inner-product Optimal TurboQuant

For important applications like nearest neighbor search, having an unbiased inner product estimator
is essential. However,TurboQuantmsepresented in Section 3.1 does not provide unbiased inner
product estimates with query vectors. To illustrate this, consider the case with a bit-width ofb= 1.
In this scenario, the optimal codebooks that solve the optimization problem in Eq. (4), for sufficiently

larged, are

```

```
```

. This implies that the quantization map forTurboQuantmseisQmse(x) =

sign(Π·x) for anyx∈Rd, and the dequantization map isQ−mse^1 (z) =

```
q

```
```
⊤·zfor anyz∈

{− 1 ,+1}d. Therefore, for large enoughd, according to Lemma 4, we haveE

#### 


```

```
#### 

#### =

2
π·⟨y,x⟩, which has a multiplicative bias of 2/π. This bias diminishes with increasing bit-widthsb,
as we empirically demonstrate in Section 4.1.

To address this bias, we propose a solution that combinesTurboQuantmsewith an instance of
QJL [62]. Specifically, letQmsebe the quantization map corresponding toTurboQuantmsewith a
bit-width ofb−1. For anyx∈Sd−^1 the residual vector, defined asr:=x−Q−mse^1 (Qmse(x)), has
a small L2 norm, i.e., on expectationE[∥r∥] =

p
C(fX,b−1) (per Eq. (4)). We can then apply
the QJL quantization mapQqjlon this residual vector, resulting in an overall bit-width ofband
providing the following unbiased inner product estimator:

```

A pseudocode for this procedure is given in Algorithm 2.

We prove the main result forTurboQuantprodin the following theorem.


Theorem 2(performance guarantee:TurboQuantprod).For any bit-widthb≥ 1 and any vector
x ∈ Sd−^1 , the procedure Quantprod(x) in Algorithm 2 outputs an index vector idx ∈ [2b−^1 ]d
along with a sign vectorqjl∈ {− 1 , 1 }d and a positive numberγ≥ 0. When these vectors and
the scalar value are passed to the primitiveDeQuantprod(idx,qjl,γ), it produces a reconstructed
vectorx ̃∈Rdthat for any vectory∈Rdsatisfies the following properties:

- Expected inner-productEx ̃[⟨y,x ̃⟩] =⟨y,x⟩
- Inner-product distortion defined asDprod :=Ex ̃

- For small bit-widths, specificallyb= 1, 2 , 3 , 4 ,Dprodexhibits finer-grained distortion values:
    Dprod≈^1 .d^57 ,^0 .d^56 ,^0 .d^18 ,^0.^047 d , respectively.

Proof.First we compute the conditional expectation of the inner product estimate⟨y,x ̃⟩condi-
tioned onx ̃mseas follows:

```
E[⟨y,x ̃⟩|x ̃mse] = E
x ̃qjl
```
#### 

#### 

```
⟨y,x ̃qjl⟩|x ̃mse
```
#### 

```
=⟨y,x ̃mse⟩+⟨y,r⟩
=⟨y,x⟩,
```
where the first equality follows from the definition ofx ̃ in line 12 of the algorithm. The third
equality above follows from Lemma 4 and last line follows from definition of the residual vector
r=x−x ̃msein line 6. Now we can computed the unconditional expectation using the law of total
expectation:Ex ̃[⟨y,x ̃⟩] =Ex ̃mse[E[⟨y,x ̃⟩|x ̃mse]] =E[⟨y,x⟩] =⟨y,x⟩, which proves the first claim of
the theorem.

We apply the same conditioning onx ̃mse, when computing the distortion, and then compute the
resulting conditional distortion:

where the second equality above follows from the definitions ofrandx ̃msein lines 6 and 10 of
Algorithm 2. The third line above follows becauseE[⟨y,x ̃qjl⟩] =⟨y,r⟩, by Lemma 4. The last line
follows from the variance bound of QJL estimator shown in Lemma 4 and using the fact thatx ̃qjl
in line 11 is re-scaled byγ=∥r∥.


Now by law of total expectation along with the fact thatr=x−x ̃msewe can bound the inner
product distortion as follows:

```
Dprod= E

The theorem follows by invoking the MSE bounds from Theorem 1 with bit-widthb−1.

### 3.3 Lower Bounds

We show thatTurboQuantachieves an optimal distortion rate, up to a small constant factor,
for any bit-width by proving lower bounds on the best achievable distortion for any compression
algorithm. Our lower bound proof leverages Yao’s minimax principle. This principle allows us to
relate the lower bound for randomized algorithms with worst-case deterministic input vectors to the
lower bound for deterministic algorithms with randomized input vectors. Subsequently, we derive
a lower bound on the achievable distortion rate for the latter using Shannon’s lower bound (SLB)
presented in Section 2.1. Formally, we prove the following theorem.

Theorem 3(lower bound on best achievable compression distortion). For any randomized quanti-
zation algorithmQ:Sd−^1 →{ 0 , 1 }b·dwith bit-widthband any reconstruction mapQ−^1 :{ 0 , 1 }b·d→
Rd, there exist a hard input instancex∈Sd−^1 such that:

Proof.By Yao’s minimax principle the expected MSE of the optimal randomized compression al-
gorithm for worst-case inputs (Dmse) is equal to the expected MSE of the optimal deterministic
compression algorithm when applied to inputs drawn from a maximally difficult randomized distri-
bution. By definition, the MSE of the latter scenario is lower-bounded by the best achievable MSE
for inputs uniformly distributed on the unit hypersphere.

The best achievable MSE for a compression algorithm with bit-widthb, operating on uniformly
distributed inputs from the sphereSd−^1 , is lower bounded in Lemma 3. Therefore, by invoking
Lemma 3 we conclude thatDmse≥ 41 b.


Furthermore, fromDmse≥ 41 b and using the definition ofDmsewe conclude that:

We note that a comparable lower bound for theworst-casedistortion in vector quantization can
be derived using “sphere packing” arguments (indeed, with larger constants as this is a harder
problem) [26]. However, Theorem 3 offers a more robust and relevant lower bound for our analysis.
This is because it establishes a lower bound on theexpected distortion, rather than the worst-case
error, and aligns seamlessly with our upper bounds presented in Theorem 1 and Theorem 2.

## 4 Experiments

All experiments are performed using a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. The experimental section is
divided into two parts: one to empirically validate the theoretical results, and another to evaluate
the performance of our methods on downstream tasks, specifically KV cache quantization and
nearest neighbor vector search.

### 4.1 Empirical Validation

In this section, we verify the theoretical results established in previous sections. We conduct our
experiments using the DBpedia Entities dataset, which has been encoded into a 1536-dimensional
space using OpenAI3 embeddings. To perform our experiments, we randomly sample 100,000 data
points from the dataset, denoted as training set, which serves as our primary dataset. Additionally,
we extract 1,000 distinct entries, denoted as query set, to be used as query points.

We evaluate two quantization methods: TurboQuantprodandTurboQuantmse. The method
TurboQuantmseis designed to be optimzed for estimating the mean squared error (MSE) between
the quantized and original vectors. In contrast,TurboQuantprodis unbiased for estimating the
inner product between the quantized and original vectors.

Both methods are applied to the task of inner product estimation by quantizing training set and
analyzing the distortion in inner product calculations across different bit widths. As shown in Fig. 1,
increasing the bit width reduces variance in both methods. However, when used for inner product
estimation,TurboQuantmseintroduces bias. This bias diminishes as the bit width increases and
eventually converges to zero.

Figure 1: Error distribution ofTurboQuantprodandTurboQuantmsefor Inner Product Estima-
tion.

The experimental results, illustrated in Fig. 1, confirm thatTurboQuantprodremains unbiased
for inner product estimation across all bit widths, whileTurboQuantmsegradually improves with
increasing bit width.

As observed in Fig. 2, when quantizing to 2 bits, the variance remains constant regardless of the
inner product of the original vector in theTurboQuantprodapproach. However, the same plot
indicates that the bias in theTurboQuantmseapproach is dependent on the average inner product.
As the average inner product increases, the bias also increases.

Along with the histograms, we also plot Section 4.1 the average inner product error and MSE
between the original and quantized vectors across different bit ratios. These plots are drawn along-
side the upper and lower bounds established in our theoretical analysis. Our observations confirm
that the results align with the theoretical predictions. Specifically, for inner product estimation,
theTurboQuantprodapproach performs better at lower bit ratios. However, as the bit count
increases,TurboQuantmsereduces bias and ultimately achieves superior performance in inner
product estimation.

assessing whether the model can successfully extract it.

Following the experimental setup of Fu et al. [21], we conduct evaluations using theLlama- 3. 1 -
8B-Instructmodel. To analyze performance across different input sequence lengths, we vary the
document size from4k to 104k tokens. The primary metric used for evaluation is therecall score,
which measures how accurately the model retrieves the hidden sentence.

For comparison, we benchmark our approach against several state-of-the-art memory-efficient meth-
ods, including PolarQuant [28], SnapKV [38], PyramidKV [12], and KIVI [41]. Each method is
tested under a memory compression ratio of 0.25, meaning that only 25% of the full KV cache is
utilized.

The results, illustrated in Fig. 4, reveal that quantization methods with theoretical guarantees, such
as PolarQuant andTurboQuant, outperform token-level compression techniques like SnapKV
and PyramidKV, as well as scalar quantization approaches like KIVI, which lack formal theoretical
guarantees. Notably,TurboQuantachieves identical performance to the full-precision model,
even at 4×compression, making it a robust solution for long-context processing.

### 4.3 End-to-end Generation on LongBench

We experiment with various KV cache compression algorithms on the LongBench dataset [10], which
encompasses a broad range of long-text scenarios, including single- and multi-document question-
answering, summarization, few-shot learning, synthetic tasks, and code completion. To ensure a
balanced evaluation across different context lengths, we employLongBench-E, a subset designed
with a more uniform length distribution. This enables a fair assessment of each model’s performance
across varying context sizes, making it a more reliable benchmark for evaluating compression tech-
niques.

We compareTurboQuantagainst the leading baseline methods introduced in Section 4.2, us-
ing bothLlama- 3. 1 - 8B-InstructandMinistral-7B-Instruct. Unlike existing approaches such as
KIVIandPolarQuant, which leave generated tokens unquantized, our method applies quantiza-
tion even during the streaming generation process.

As shown in Table 1, our approach outperforms other methods for bothLlama- 3. 1 - 8B-Instructand
Ministral-7B-Instruct, achieving significantly higher average scores. We evaluate our method
using2.5-bitand3.5-bitquantization during text generation. These non-integer bit precisions
result from our strategy of splitting channels into outlier and non-outlier sets, and applying two
independent instances ofTurboQuantto each, allocating higher bit precision to outliers. This
outlier treatment strategy is consistent with prior work [63, 51]. For example, in our 2.5-bit setup,
32 outlier channels are quantized at 3 bits, while the remaining 96 channels use 2 bits, leading to
an effective bit precision of (32×3 + 96×2)/128 = 2.5. For 3.5-bit quantization, a different ratio of
outliers and regular channels leads to a higher effective bit precision. Despite using fewer bits than
competing techniques,TurboQuantmaintains performance comparable to unquantized models.
Remarkably, we achieve this while compressing quantized vectors by at least a factor of 4. 5 ×.

Figure 4: Evaluation of Llama-3.1-8B-Instructon the “Needle-In-A-Haystack” test, where a
model must retrieve a hidden sentence from long-context sequences. While some methods struggle
with recall,TurboQuant, despite being more than 4×quantized, achieves the same exact perfor-
mance as the uncompressed baseline.

### 4.4 Near Neighbour Search Experiments

In this section, we establish the strength of our proposed method, even in the context of near-
neighbor search. We conduct our experiments using the DBpedia [53] Entities dataset, which has
been encoded into 1536-dimensional^1 and 3072-dimensional^2 spaces using OpenAI3 embeddings.
Additionally, we evaluate performance on a lower-dimensional dataset, utilizing the standard GloVe
[45] embeddings. To construct our experimental setup, we randomly sample 100,000 data points
from the dataset, denoted as training set, which serves as our primary training and evaluation set.
Furthermore, we extract 1,000 distinct entries, denoted as query set, to be used as query points for
datasets that do not explicitly provide a query set. For the GloVe dataset, we use a pre-existing
query set consisting of 10,000 points.

We compare our method,TurboQuant, against two baseline quantization approaches: Product
Quantization (PQ) and RabitQ [22]. To ensure a fair comparison, we quantize the dataset training
set using all three methods and evaluate their performance based on recall ratio at top-k, denoted
as 1@k. Specifically, this metric assesses how often the true top inner product result is captured
within the top-k approximated results returned by each algorithm.

Product Quantization (PQ)relies on the k-means algorithm to construct codebooks, which
require separate storage. As the number of bits increases, the size of the codebook grows exponen-

tially, leading to additional storage overhead. In our experiments, we carefully tuned the parameters
to match the bit allocation of other methods. The most efficient implementation, designed for rapid
querying, employs AVX2 In-Register Lookup Tables (LUTs). Specifically, it uses LUT16 with (l
= 16) codewords. However, we observed substantial quality degradation at this configuration. To
achieve a balance between speed and accuracy, we opted for a version of PQ that uses LUT256,
which contains 256 codewords. For 2-bit quantization, it groups 4 coordinates per lookup, while for
4-bit quantization, it groups 2 coordinates per lookup. Notably, since we use the same dataset for
both training and evaluation, PQ benefits from an inherent advantage in this setup.

RabitQ.Unlike PQ, RabitQ lacks a fully vectorized implementation, making it impossible to
leverage GPU acceleration. As a result, it runs significantly slower on CPU. Additionally, the
method incurs extra computational overheads that we do not explicitly account for in the bit ratio
comparisons. While RabitQ claims a certain bit ratio, in practice, it utilizes more bits than reported
due to these inefficiencies.

Despite the advantages granted to the baseline methods,TurboQuantconsistently outperforms
both Product Quantization and RabitQ in terms of recall ratio across all experiments. This demon-
strates the robustness and efficiency of our approach, making it a compelling alternative for high-
dimensional quantization-based search tasks.
